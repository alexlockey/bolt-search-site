We tracked hiring patterns across 200+ funded EdTech companies in the UK over the past 12 months. The shift is clear: the market has moved from building products to selling them.

The most in-demand roles aren't engineers or product managers. They're commercial directors, partnership leads, and customer success managers who understand the education buyer. Schools and colleges buy differently from corporates — and EdTech companies are learning that the hard way.

Three things stand out from the data: first, companies that raised Series A+ are hiring commercial teams 40% faster than they're hiring engineering. Second, the most successful hires are people with direct education sector experience — not just SaaS experience from other verticals. Third, fractional and part-time arrangements are increasingly common for senior roles as companies try to bring in experience without burning through their runway.

If you're an EdTech company building your commercial team, we know this market inside out. [Let's talk](/contact).
