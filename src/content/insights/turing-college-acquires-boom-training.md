In a move set to shake up the UK tech education landscape, Y Combinator-backed [Turing College](https://www.turingcollege.com) has acquired [Boom Training](https://www.boom-training.com). This union brings together cutting-edge tech education with well-established apprenticeship expertise - potentially changing how tech skills are taught across the country.

## A Match Made for Modern Learning

The deal marries two very different but complementary strengths. Turing College, founded in 2017, has made a name for itself with flexible, results-driven training in machine learning, data science and web technology. They've grown to serve over 3,000 students across more than 70 countries.

On the other side, Boom Training brings eleven years of hands-on know-how in UK apprenticeships, particularly in digital marketing and business admin.

Lukas Kaminskis, Turing College's CEO, explains the vision behind the acquisition:

"We believe the combination of Turing's tech-native, self-paced learning model with Boom's deep expertise in apprenticeships is exactly what this moment calls for. We're not here to copy-paste what's already been done. Together, we'll build something new: apprenticeship programs that actually reflect how modern professionals learn and work."## Breaking New Ground

The tech apprenticeship space has long been ripe for disruption. Many traditional programs haven't kept pace with how tech skills are actually used in the workplace. Kaminskis adds"

"This acquisition positions us to be a serious challenger in a space where innovation has lagged behind demand. With Boom, we're well placed to scale to a better model - one that delivers for both learners and employers."For Boom Training, finding the right buyer was crucial. Shirley Wolfe, Director at Boom Training, shares:

> "Having invested in setting up Boom Training some eleven years ago, it was important that any potential buyer had the same cultural ethos and would continue to grow the business in the direction of our vision for the future - Data/Digital sector. Turing offered this and more, being able to introduce new ideas and up to date technology for the delivery of these courses. I'm excited to see them make a difference in the Digital World of Learning."## Navigating the Transaction
Bolt Advisory guided the acquisition process, working with Turing College as their buy-side advisor throughout the journey.

Alex Lockey, founder of Bolt Search and Bolt Advisory, sees this as a standout deal:

"In a training provider market that's getting more consolidated by the day, this match just makes sense. Both teams are passionate about quality and innovation, but bring different strengths to the table.> "Turing has built impressive relationships with major players like Danske Bank, Accenture, Telia, and Nasdaq. Their training gets rave reviews, with NPS scores that speak volumes about their quality. When you combine this with Boom's deep understanding of UK apprenticeships, you've got something special.> "What I'm seeing across the sector is growing frustration with training that doesn't reflect how people actually work in tech today. This combination tackles that problem head-on."The transaction was delivered through a collaboration between Bolt Advisory and Thomsett Advisory, leveraging Bolt's long-standing client relationships across the FE and regulated training market, with both firms contributing to the advisory process from early engagement through to completion.

This project builds on Bolt Advisory's longstanding experience in UK further education and training, and highlights its growing role in connecting high-quality learning providers with strategic international investment.

## What's Next
The expanded Turing College will roll out new apprenticeship programs in the coming months, starting with data, software development, and digital marketing roles.

The timing couldn't be better. In 2023, Turing's data bootcamp programs were named among the best globally by CourseReport and Fortune Magazine. Their graduates consistently outperform their peers, earning substantially higher salaries than those from competing programs. With a remarkable 97% qualification achievement rate across their European government contracts, they're perfectly positioned to make waves in the UK apprenticeship market.

As tech continues to transform every industry, this merger aims to create a new standard for digital skills training - one that better serves both learners looking to break into tech and employers desperate for relevant, up-to-date skills that actually make a difference in the workplace.
