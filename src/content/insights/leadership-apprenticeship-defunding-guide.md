The government's decision to defund management and leadership apprenticeships has sent shockwaves through the training provider sector. For many providers, these programmes represented 30-50% of revenue. The question isn't whether this will hurt  -  it's how quickly you can adapt.

## What's Actually Happening

The Skills Funding Agency has confirmed that Level 5+ management and leadership apprenticeship standards will lose government co-investment funding from April 2026. This affects programmes like the Senior Leader Apprenticeship (Level 7), Operations/Departmental Manager (Level 5), and Coaching Professional (Level 5).

## The Commercial Impact

For training providers who built their business around leadership apprenticeships, the numbers are stark. A provider delivering 200 leadership apprenticeship starts per year at an average funding band of £14,000 is looking at a £2.8m revenue gap.

## Three Survival Strategies

### 1. Pivot to Employer-Funded Delivery

The demand for leadership development hasn't disappeared  -  only the government subsidy. Organisations still need to develop their managers. The providers who survive will be those who can repackage their leadership programmes as commercial offerings that employers pay for directly.

### 2. Diversify Into Adjacent Standards

Look at the apprenticeship standards that remain funded and align with your delivery capability. Digital skills, data, project management, and sector-specific technical standards all have strong employer demand and retain government funding.

### 3. Build the Commercial Function You've Been Avoiding

Most training providers grew their leadership programmes through levy relationships and procurement. Selling commercial training programmes requires a fundamentally different sales capability  -  one that many providers don't have. Now is the time to hire or develop that commercial function.

## What This Means for Hiring

We're already seeing training providers restructure. The demand is shifting from programme delivery roles toward commercial and business development talent. Providers need people who can sell, not just deliver.
