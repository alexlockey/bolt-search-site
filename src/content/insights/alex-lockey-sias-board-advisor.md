The Society of Independent Schools and Sixth Form Colleges (SIAS) has appointed Alex Lockey, Managing Partner of Bolt Search, to its board in an advisory capacity. This appointment reflects growing recognition that skills training and technical education expertise are essential to education sector leadership at the highest levels. SIAS represents a significant cohort of independent education providers, and the addition of Lockey's perspective brings direct experience working with education businesses across growth, acquisition, and strategic transformation.

Lockey brings distinctive perspective grounded in commercial education market dynamics. His work advising education providers, MATs, and independent schools on strategic partnerships, acquisition, and operational transformation provides insight into how market forces are reshaping education provision. His appointment signals that SIAS recognises independent education provision must evolve—maintaining academic excellence whilst remaining strategically aligned with labour market demands and emerging skills priorities. The independent sector has distinctive advantages in innovation and flexibility that position it well for this evolution.

The timing of this appointment reflects broader sector conversations about independence and viability. Independent education institutions operate outside direct government funding structures, giving them freedom to innovate but creating revenue vulnerability if they become misaligned with what students, parents, and employers actually value. Technical skills training, apprenticeships, and employer-sponsored professional development represent growth opportunities for independent providers positioned correctly. Conversely, providers remaining entirely focused on traditional academic provision face demographic headwinds and competitive pressure from subsidised state alternatives.

Lockey's involvement with SIAS will likely focus on strategic positioning of independent providers within the evolving skills landscape, particularly around technical and commercial education, employer engagement, and strategic partnerships that extend market reach. For SIAS members, this represents access to perspective on how market dynamics are reshaping education, where capital is deploying, and how independent providers can position themselves for sustainable growth in an era of rapid change. The appointment reflects recognition that education sector leadership increasingly requires comfort with commercial dynamics, market forces, and strategic positioning—not purely educational expertise.
