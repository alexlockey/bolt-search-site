Education businesses that have attracted institutional investor capital are discovering a fundamental tension: investors expect growth trajectories and return profiles similar to software or services businesses, whilst education delivery imposes operational constraints that make those trajectories extremely difficult to achieve. This misalignment between investor expectations and operational reality is the primary source of dysfunction in many board relationships and the leading cause of premature CEO transitions.

The tension originates in legitimate but incompatible assumptions. Investors assume education is an information delivery business where scaling capacity is largely a technology and distribution problem. Larger student cohorts, digital delivery, and operational leverage should drive margins as the business scales. Operators understand education as a people-intensive, relationship-dependent delivery service where quality is inseparable from direct educator-learner interaction. Adding students without proportionally adding quality educators usually degrades outcomes, destroys reputation, and paradoxically reduces long-term growth potential. These models are fundamentally misaligned.

Successful education entrepreneurs have managed this tension through rigorous discipline about what business they're actually in. Providers that position as technology platforms serving education (rather than education providers using technology) can scale more easily to investor expectations. Providers that remain authentically education-focused instead acknowledge that sustainable growth requires margin discipline, quality focus, and modest scaling pace—then develop investor relationships around realistic return expectations. The failure mode occurs when entrepreneurs promise venture-backed growth to investors whilst trying to operate quality education delivery, creating impossible tension that typically ends in CEO departure.

For sitting CEOs managing investor relationships, several strategies reduce misalignment. First, establish clarity early about business model realities—what margins are sustainable, how growth constraints operate, what capital is actually required. Investors would rather understand constraints upfront than discover them mid-term. Second, define leading indicators that matter more than top-line growth: learner outcomes, employer satisfaction, staff retention, NPS—metrics that predict long-term sustainability and brand strength. Third, create realistic financial models that acknowledge education constraints rather than baking in efficiency improvements that require compromising educational quality.

The most sustainable education businesses have investor relationships grounded in mutual understanding about what the business actually is—not wishful thinking about education sector transformation. This requires CEOs willing to have difficult conversations with investors about realistic opportunity size and growth pace. It also requires investors educated enough about education delivery to recognise that certain operational constraints are features, not bugs, and that respecting them creates long-term value rather than destroying it.
